# Project Descriptions for Team hm475-ss3296-zsj5

## hm475
This project involves creating a gesture-controlled interactive light using the NXP FRDM KL46Z board, which will utilize its onboard accelerometer and touch sensors to control the pattern and color of both the onboard LEDs and the 3 additional LEDs of the external board. The goal is to provide an interactive experience where different gestures and touch inputs result in various light animations, allowing for complex gestures to result in interesting results, visible instantaneously through the LEDs.

# Feedback

Ok. This is a pretty reasonable project. Pick some specific examples and then add complexity. 

(Optional) If you want more hardware, you can direclty plug in a WS2812 light strip (wich you can get from amazon) to the little LED board. It would be an easy way to add LEDs to your experience. 

# Project Web-Page

The project web-pages will also be hosted on github in this repo in the "page" branch. You can edit it by switching branches and modifying the files, or by pushing to the branch. Here is a link to a minmal web-page that you can edit and modify: [https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2024/hm475-ss3296-zsj5](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2024/hm475-ss3296-zsj5)
